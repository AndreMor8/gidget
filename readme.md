# Super Solar-Powered Robot 3000 a.k.a Gidget

Gidget here is a customized Discord bot, the name comes from the _Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!_ show with the robot of the same name.

It was created in the hope that it would be useful, since AndreMor really wanted _Wow Wow Discord_ to have its own bot.

## Some details

This bot uses Discord.js v12.2.0 to interact with the Discord API.

The command/event handler base and reaction-role system are based on [**this code**](https://github.com/ansonfoong/discordjs-v12-bot).

This bot has a database, the type is MongoDB and Mongoose is used to access it. The database is hosted in MongoDB Atlas.

`admins.js` and `mods.js`, as well as the Admin list in `serverinfo.js` are exclusive to Wow Wow Discord in this bot.

The `my-first-time` folder contains basic commands from what was my first time in JavaScript. They were passed from NuggetBot (CC feature) to this bot, if you remix the project you may not want these commands.

This bot is compatible with DM channels. Although not all commands will obviously work.
