Gidget is a customized Discord bot. The name comes from the [_Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!_](https://wubbzy.fandom.com/wiki/Wubbzy "Wubbzy Fandom") show with the robot of the same name.

It was created with the hope of it would be useful, since AndreMor really wanted that the [_Wow Wow Discord_][wwd] have his own bot.

The real bot on Discord is *Gidget#2936* with ID *694306281736896573*.

In this repository you can see the source code of Gidget to learn how it works or to add Gidget commands to another bot instances.

Also you are invited to add the bot to your servers using this link: https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=694306281736896573&scope=bot

If you want to join into the support server, here is the invite link: https://discord.gg/KDy4gJ7

Note that self-hosting is not dynamic, you will need to change some parts of the code for Gidget to suit you.

If you don't know how to program, I recommend you to use the public bot. You will have no problem doing that.

## Some details

This bot uses Discord.js v13.x to interact with the Discord API.

The command/event handler base and reaction-role system are based on [**this code**](https://github.com/ansonfoong/discordjs-v12-bot).

This bot uses a MongoDB database hosted in MongoDB Atlas and Mongoose to access it.
If you are going to self-host, you will need a MongoDB database.

The commands `admins.js` and `mods.js`, as well as the Admin list in `serverinfo.js` are exclusive to [Wow Wow Discord][wwd].

The `my-first-time` folder contains basic commands from my first time in JavaScript. They was passed from NuggetBot (CC feature) to this bot, and they are only used by the [Wow Wow Discord][wwd] server.

Some commands in this bot have *Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!* as topic or refer to it.

This bot is compatible with DM channels. Although, not all commands will obviously work.

You can freely contribute to the bot in the [GitHub](https://github.com/AndreMor8/gidget/) repository either by issues or by pull requests. If the changes are approved, then you will see them in the real bot. Thanks for contributing.
