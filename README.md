# Welcome

Welcome to the Gidget documentation page.

Here AndreMor will be documenting everything related to the bot, such as its commands and functions, so you can know for sure what this bot does.

Gidget is a Discord bot that previously only served the [Wow Wow Discord server](https://gidget.xyz/wwd), but thanks to improved code and the addition of commands, AndreMor decided to make it public.

Gidget is open source and you can support its development on [GitHub](https://github.com/AndreMor955/gidget).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Gidget is still in beta, it means that this bot will do reboots depending on the commits in the repository and what AndreMor decides.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For the end user \(the one who uses the public bot in Discord\), join this [support](https://discord.gg/KDy4gJ7) server, any report or question will be answered here.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
`<>` =&gt; Required

`[]` =&gt; Optional
{% endhint %}

Hope you enjoy this bot =D
