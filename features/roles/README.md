# Roles

### Voice-roles

Make users have a role when they are connected to a voice channel, take them out when they leave.

### Reaction-roles

{% page-ref page="../reactions/reaction-roles.md" %}

### Retrieving roles

If a user leaves the server, have their roles returned to them when they return to the server.
